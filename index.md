## Project Description

Our project is an Magic Leap AR "Island Colonization" video game where the player attempts to take over floating islands by defeating enemies. The player can switch between a high-level overview of the world where they distribute units to different floating islands and a low-level view where they actually walk onto the island and watch the battle themselves.

## Team Bio
- **Anny Kong**
    - I am a senior at UW majoring in computer science. While I am a big fan of VR/AR as well as great games, it's super exiciting to make a game with AR technologies.
- **Charles Mihran**
    - I am a senior in computer science at UW Settle, but I'm initially from the Bay Area in California. I grew up loving playing video games ranging from Halo to Pokemon and have been interested in game development for a while. I've made some games on my own but am excited to work on a team to creating a game in AR. When I was younger I loved games from the "Command and Conquer" series and am excited to make a strategy game of our own.
- **Xiuxing Lao**
    - I am a senior student in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I always believe that great story can be told in AR.
- **Yuyang Ge**
    - I am a senior studying computer science at UW Seattle. I am also minor in Music and Math, concentrated in biopsychology. I have developed games in the past for iOS system but this is the first time I get the oppotunity to development a game in AR. I believe that VR/AR will be an integral part of the furture, and I am very excited to be working with a team to make a strategy game of our own.

### Week 4
#### Island Rendering and RTS Research
**Introduction**: This week we've focused primarily on figuring out how we want to render islands in the magic leap AR space, as well as learning the basics of the RTS engine we'll be using. As islands are the main part of the game we wanted to make sure that they will look good and that the movement around them feels fluid. We've been able to place the islands in the 3D space around the player and are looking more into the modification of the islands. 

**Progress**: We finished the design for smaller islands (where the units will be placed and fights). First, we brought the assets package for design of the islands, but it included many demos, materials, and textures which we could choose from. Eventually we settle on a very simple design of the islands with big open space which the fights could take place. One of the struggles we faced was that all the materials were all in one level of hierarchy which made scale and move the entire island very difficult. We asked for help and eventually figure out how to create new objects to included different materials for different levels of hierarchy. Another struggle is that we could not figure out where to place the camera. It took us some experiments to know that the rotation of the initial position of the camera should be 0 and we should only change the y-axis of the camera position. Below is the screen shot of the islands in perspective to x, y, and z axis.

### Week 3
#### Website, PRD, and Gameplay Plans
We created our website and set up the inital draft of our PRD, or the project requirements document. We've laid out weekly milestones and member responsibilies that will hopefully help us stay on track while we get started on developing our game. We've also laid out our plans for gameplay to have a more concrete understanding on how we want the game to be played. We've decided that each island will have their own battle happening that the player must manage. Each battle will consist of the player attempting to take over the island by destroying all the enemies on it. We also want to have some basic base-building in our game, such as having buildings that generate resources for the player and buildings that let the player spend resources to create units. Taking over the island will include destroying the enemy player's units and buildings. After an island is conquered, we're envisioning some way for the player to transfer units to new islands to aid in the conquering of the new islands. We've also decided on a general aesthetic theme for the game. Instead of a space theme we've gone with a more fantasy style. We've found assets that include stuff like knights, monsters, and medieval buildings in a low-poly style to keep our assets consistent.

### Week 2
#### Project decided
We decided on a project! Initially we wanted to have some sort of space RTS in VR, but decided that it wasn't novel enough given that games like Lazer Bait already exist. After trying out the Magic Leap, we became excited at the idea of making an AR game. We liked our "planet colonization" game idea but decided to switch the planets into islands to make the game aesthetic more unique. We also decided that part of the novel gameplay of our game will be how the player interacts with the island. The play will see floating islands around them and have the option to zoom-in to them and get a larger field of the battlefield, walking over everything to get a better view. They can then zoom-out to get a larger view of all the islands. 

### Week 1
#### Hello world! 
We've met our group, set up some collaborationt tools and are brainstorming possible ideas for our project. More updates to follow through these blog posts as we continue to make more progress.
