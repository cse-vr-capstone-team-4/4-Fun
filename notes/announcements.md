Hey Class,

First off, great job on the initial proposals and the in-person pitches today! 
We were impressed by the range of ideas, and think this is going to be a really exciting set of projects. 
A few announcements:

1) Purchasing: The purchasing website, where you will submit receipts/requests, 
needs a few more days to get ready. Until then if you need to buy something for 
testing, please save receipts. Keep the budget in mind (~$500) when purchasing. 
Unity Asset Store is a good place to start, but you may also find some free/cheaper 
alternatives in the 3D assets links.

2) Devices: Please decide by Tuesday what device/platform your team will use for the quarter, 
so that we can allocate them efficiently. We will collect this info at the lecture.

3) Gitlab instructions are on the google groups. Instructions to set up your blogs/websites are coming soon.

4) Next week's deliverables: Device choice (Tuesday), PRD (Thursday), Website (Friday) -- details forthcoming

5) Team e-mails: If you need, we have set up team e-mails as vr-capstone-team1@cs.washington.edu 
(team2, team3 etc.).  Staff e-mail is vr-capstone-staff@cs

This is going to be an exciting week where you will further explore and solidify your ideas 
and start experimenting with the basic frameworks for your platform:

Windows Mixed Reality: Academy, Developer Website
Magic Leap: Creator Guides
