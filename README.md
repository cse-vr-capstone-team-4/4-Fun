### Description of project: Island Warfare

Our project is an Magic Leap AR "Island Colonization" video game where the player attempts to take over floating islands by defeating enemies. The player can switch between a high-level overview of the world where they distribute units to different floating islands and a low-level view where they actually walk onto the island and watch the battle themselves.
